# maximus
Named after the first circus in the city of Rome, Maximus is our (first) IoT platform.

## Basic Idea
The fundamental idea here is create a software layer above the physical devices where heavy-duty work will be done. This way changes like permissions can be made to an IoT setup without needing to touch the physical devices.

## Components
* Device (with states, actions)
